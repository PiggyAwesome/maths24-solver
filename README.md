## How it works
This program uses the random module to randomly choose an operator, puts the stated numbers in random position and evaluates it, till it gets to 24!

All you need to use this is:
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

Any form of text editor. (Notepad will work)

# How to use this:
Run the python file by opening a terminal in the directory of the file and typing:

`python solve.py`

You will be prompted for the numbers. Enter the first number, press enter, then the second, and so on...

After you have entered the fourth number, the program will try to find the solution!


Wait for it to finish and you will get your awnser!
